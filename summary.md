# Summary

In this lab you learned how to create an Azure SQL DB and configure it use the new Vector search. You also used Entity Framework Core to create the database table with a VECTOR field type using migrations. Then you created the database access code to save and retrieve vector embeddings as well as perform a similarity search in Azure SQL. 

The second section was all about building a ChatBot using Azure OpenAI, Semantic Kernel and Entity Framework Core to perform RAG using data in Azure SQL.

The lab ended with a fully functioning ChatBot built with Semantic Kernel and using Azure OpenAI's gpt-4o model.
