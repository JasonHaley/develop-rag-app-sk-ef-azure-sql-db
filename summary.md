# Summary

In this lab you learned how to create an Azure SQL DB and configure it use Vector search. You also used Entity Framework Core to create the database table with a VECTOR field type using migrations. Then you created the database access code to save and retrieve vector embeddings and perform a similarity search.

The lab ended with a fully functioning ChatBot built with Semantic Kernel and using Azure OpenAI's gpt-4o model.
